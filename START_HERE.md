- Type-safe with form requests
- Spatie permissions

### Frontend
✅ **Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind**
- SPA with client-side routing
- Composition API
- Pinia state management
- Full type safety

### Database
✅ **Normalized schema**
- ProductVariant replaces ProductVariable
- Proper relationships
- Indexed for performance
- Migrations included

### DevOps
✅ **GitHub Actions + Docker**
- Automated testing
- Automated deployment
- Multiple environments (local, staging, prod)
- Health checks & monitoring
